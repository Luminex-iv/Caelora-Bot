Scripts folder notes

Purpose
- Store utility and deployment scripts used by maintainers and CI.

What to put here
- `deploy/` - helper scripts to build releases.
- `db_migrate.sh` - simple migration runner for local/testing.

Ideas
- Keep `upload.sh` at repo root as the main deploy helper; scripts here can be invoked by it.

NOTES / extras
- List script responsibilities and required environment variables for each script.
