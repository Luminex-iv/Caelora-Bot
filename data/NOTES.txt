Data folder notes

Purpose
- Store runtime persistent or semi-persistent artifacts such as small JSON databases, caches, or dumps.

What to put here
- `users.json` - small datasets for prototyping (avoid for production scale).
- `backup/` - automated backups snapshots (if used).

Ideas
- If data becomes large, consider migrating to an external DB rather than committing here.

NOTES / extras
- Document data retention and cleanup policies.
