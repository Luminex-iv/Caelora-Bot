Testing notes

Purpose
- Hold test plans, examples, and conventions for writing unit and integration tests.

What to put here
- `test_conventions.md` - naming and directory structure conventions.
- `ci_integration.md` - how tests run in CI and how to reproduce locally.

Ideas
- Add sample tests: `tests/test_smoke.py`, `tests/cogs/test_example.py`.
- Use fixtures for common objects (fake bot, config overrides).

NOTES / extras
- Track flaky tests to stabilize.
- Document any test data generation scripts.
